PROJECTS
=========

Noviflow Inc, Montreal, Canada 			(from Aug 2018 to July 2024 )
-------------------------------------------------------------------

SDN based multi-Terabits Network switch for Edge Programmable Networks.

    • AMD Pensendo Elba DSC SSDK 1.78 used for the cross compilation to ARM core application running on the DPU. Designed the API’s for the hardware interaction which includes code generation of API’s using python. The ardware API were changing based on the table name.

    • Designed customized Python gRPC based unit test system capable of testing Control Plane and Dataplane for Tofino and Pensando based System using dynamic mock SSDK Api’s. This setup extensively helped in reproducing, simplying, analysis of the system issues.
    
    • Management, Debugging and Enhancement of P4-16 VNF (Open source P4Runtime Client or Barefoot Runtime Client) as only member while working on the design, implementation on other Active Project.
    
    • Improved the C++11 understanding by doing NanoDegree from Udacity while working on the Projects used new findings to figure out a compiler optimization crash issue. Prepared a docuemntation for how to think from C to Modern C++.
    
    • Worked in both Control plane for the scalable application support and Data plane using Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors (P4) for multi-Terabits ASIC platform like Tofino and AMD Pensando Elba DSC.
    
    • Open source P4-16 Dataplane programming with programmable match-action pipelines for the  L2GRE, L2MPLS, DSCP and debugging in 6.3 Tbps.
    
    • Implementation of Tofino harware supported LAG with source/port pruning based API for multi-Terabit switch, dockerized Application, CLI using Fixed L2XID available with limited documentation. Python based Test Setup facilitates to understand complex scenarios provided by Tofino API involving combination of port, lag, multicast and rid. 
Visteon Corporation (formerly AllGo Embedded Systems), Bangalore, India
									(from May 2013 to Aug 2018)
In-Vehicle Infotainment system of Visteon/Allgo
    • Software designing, performance tuning, optimization, debugging and  bug fixing. Along with working on various projects like CarPlay, CarLife and OpenAir,  
    • Worked on the various platforms  Linux, Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwitch) Android 4.1( Jelly Bean) Android 9 on the Platform Freescale Sabre Auto, TI OMAP 5. Apple Plugin R2 to R16.
    • Android Lollypop middleware in C++11 analysed and added support for playback of audio to two interfaces simulatenously for CES Demo.
    • Development of Testing Utility for Carplay for automated support using Object Oriented methods  in C.
    • Development of MISRA C Standard based zero memory allocation CarPlay Application for Customer using Data Oriented Technique with Advance StateMachine with intergrated Timer Support. 
    • Generated sequence diagram directly from logs using PlantUml, CLI test utility for system testing for debugging. 
    • Design of Video display algorithm to match 60 h264 fps on the frame buffer, which is for CarPlay. 
    • Provided Onsite support for US Client needed for echo cancellation tuning and integration for Car model using CarPlay Audio framework. It was done using tinyalsa on Android(Jelly Bean).
    • Analysed variety of issues ranging from mDNS, Duplicate Address Detection and IPV6 multicast related issues resolved.  Linux kernel/driver issues Audio issue in USB CDC - NCM driver, Video performance issue(video patches) in socket buffer.
Sai Info Systems, Bangalore, India 		(from August 2010 to April 2013)
Android and Embedded Linux Based Video Phones
    • Designed UI and UI Control Manager with Screen Stack to be used on the Linux and Android using the Message-Oriented Communication and Data-Oriented Design State Machine and Event Rules Manager.
    • Implemented socket based Event Manager which was used as IPC mechanism between different processes/threads. POC of Android 4.0 Java with StateMachine ported from QT.
    • Mentoring of team members and proposed and executed on job training needed for the pointer heavy application in C and C++ QT code.
    • ISO Process Internal Auditor Training and CMMI High Maturity Training 
SmartLink (formely D-Link), Bangalore, India (from March 2005 to August 2010)
VOIP Phone and Embedded Networking Products
    • Developed the LCD Kernel Module for the Monochrome Samsung LCD and a LCD DisplayAbstraction to support 3 rows text and 2 rows status using BDF fonts (converted from TTF).
    • Robust Production quality design  and unit testing LCD Display manager or modern day SDK to LCD using C. Although core engine was complex but almost perfect unit testing and requirement gathering enables a quality which never crashed and zero bugs in whole lifetime of product.
    • Design, Develop and Testing of Secured RTP and acoustic echo cancellation tunning on SOC TNET 1050V 
    • Developed the web pages for Control and Management plane of the box using Rompager embedded web server. Designed and implemented (IPC Unix Sockets) G.729 TransCoder Manager for IPPBX E1 Gateway. encoding /decoding is done using Intel IPP Library. 
LG Soft India, Bangalore, India     	      (from September 2004 to March 2005)
Mobile Handset R&D Group
This project at LG involved porting of Mobile Phone from English to Korean & Vietnamese Handsets.
